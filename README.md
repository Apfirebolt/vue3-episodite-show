This is a simple web application in Vue 3 which makes use of API from Episodate.com to display TV shows related data. This app can be used to search for TV shows and see the details of the show.

[Episodate API]([https://link-url-here.org](https://www.episodate.com/api))

I was searching for open APIs which provide limited number of requests for free with useful data. I stumbled across this and thought of turning this into a Vue 3 mini-project. This project also uses dynamic components from Headless UI and is completely responsive ie mobile friendly.

## Technologies Used

- Vue 3
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Headless UI (For dynamic components)

## Features

- Users can search for a TV show.
